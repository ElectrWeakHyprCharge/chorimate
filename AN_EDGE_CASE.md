# Edge cases:

This is a possible message useful for testing the behaviour in edge cases, just one redditchoripán should be given,
but the differences in accentuation, the presence of a username or how that username could (or did) affect the number of
replies  

(**Replying to /u/ElectrWeakHyprCharge**)

    !redditchoripán  
    !redditchoripán /u/ElectrWeakHyprCharge  
    !redditchoripán /u/electrweakhyprcharge  
    !redditchoripan  
    !redditchoripan /u/ElectrWeakHyprCharge  
    !redditchoripan /u/electrweakhyprcharge  

Again, the expected behaviour for this comment is one `redditchoripán`, because there should be only one given per
recipient per comment.
